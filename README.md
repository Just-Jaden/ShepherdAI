## Example Interaction  

**User:**  
*"I feel like I'm being pulled into distractions by my friends who drink, party, and smoke. I want to stay faithful to God, but I also feel like I'm missing out. What should I do?"*  

**Shepherd.AI Response:**  
*"Your concern is valid. The pleasures of a worldly lifestyle can be tempting, but leading a Christian lifestyle is always worth it. Remember, you are not alone; God is always with you. I encourage you to pray, voice your concerns, and keep your eyes on the eternal reward. Galatians 6:8 says, 'Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.' Would you like more verses or a guided prayer?"*
